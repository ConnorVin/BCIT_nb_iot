There are 2 (potentially 3) npm project root folders.
- /
    back-end folder with express server

- /client
    front-end that will contain the react code and apexcharts. 
    anyone working solely on the front-end will probably just need to write inside this folder

- /lambda (pending)
    will contain the lambda code

/
+ client
    + node_modules
+ lambda
+ Deliverables
+ node_modules
